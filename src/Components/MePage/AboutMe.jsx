        Bachelor Degree in Psychology and a great experience in tourism - I
        found these experiences not stimulating my mind. Being a strategy games
        and logic lover, I started seeking for something that could fulfil my
        expectations. I found in programming the best opportunity to do that.
        Getting accepted to Strive School wasn't a piece of cake, but I'm having
        great results, having a tendency to be very organised and creating great
        relationships with all my fellows. Result-Driven, Optimiser - I try to
        leave a well-paved road for those who come after me. My goal, every
        single day, is to be a little be better that I was the day before. Tech
